# Siri-Shorcuts
A reference  guide for creating Siri Shortcuts

From apple's own [Donating Shortcuts article][link1], you can make donations for Shorcuts using one of the following objects: 

> NSUserActivity. Donate the shortcut using a user activity when the action involves a view within your app, such as displaying recent transactions in a banking app.

> INInteraction. Donate the shortcut using an interaction when the action involves a task the user accomplishes with your app, such as recording activity in a ski and snowboard tracking app.
